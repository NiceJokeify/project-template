# Irish Constituencies Neo4j Database
###### Pawel Borzym, G00313594

## Introduction
This is a project about the Irish General Elections that were held in 2016.
Project was done using Neo4J database, it holds information such as Candidate names, Constituencies and Political Parties. 

## Database
The Database was created using Neo4J and changes were implemented using Cypher scripts. 
These Cypher scripts were used to add Candidate Nodes(Names + Surnames), Constituency Nodes, Political Parties and Relationships between all of the nodes.
All of the scripts used in this project are located in the Supports folder.
Other scrips were used to check if nodes were created correctly and that the relationships were done correctly.

######Nodes
